I am a PhD candidate in physics and cold atom experimentalist at the University of Michigan. Currently, my research interests lie in quantum chaos, entanglement dynamics, and other quantum many-body physics. On this website, you can find...

## About Me

I began studying physics at the University of North Texas, where I was initially pursuing a music degree in instrumental performance (cello). Throughout my time at UNT physics, I worked as an assistant in the lecture demonstration lab and as a tutor, I was the president of the Society of Physics Students, and I was an undergraduate researcher in the group of Jens Neu.

In summer 2023, I had the privilege of participating in the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at the University of Michigan Department of Physics. As part of the REU, I worked on two projects in Rachel Goldman's group: Quasiparticle Interference Mapping with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope and simulations of carrier concenctration in sub-monolayer quantum dots.

Upon graduating from North Texas, I was fortunate enough to return to Michigan where I currently work with Shankari Rajagopal. Our group is in the process of designing and constructing our first experiment, a hybrid cavity-Rydberg cold atom experiment. Our platform allows us to generate interactions which are tunable from fully local (via Rydberg dressing) to fully global (via the modes of an optical cavity).
